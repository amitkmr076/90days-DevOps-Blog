Introduction To Linux.

Linux is an open-source operating system, meaning it is free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.
It is based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.
Linux is commonly used for personal computers, web servers, and many other applications.
It is designed to be user-friendly and offers a range of features, including a graphical user interface,
a wide variety of software applications, and compatibility with other operating systems

LINUX ARCHITECTURE

Linux architecture is comprised of four main components: hardware, kernel, shell, and applications. 
Hardware is the physical components of the computer, such as the CPU and motherboard. 
The kernel is the core of the operating system and manages the hardware and software resources. 
The shell is a user interface that provides access to the kernel's functions and other applications.
Finally, applications are programs that the user interacts with to perform tasks.

what is kernel and shell in linux

The kernel is the core of the Linux operating system.
It is responsible for managing system operations, memory, and I/O operations.
It also provides a platform for applications to run on.

The shell is the user interface to the kernel. 
It is a program that provides the user with an interface for interacting with the system.
The shell interprets commands entered by the user and passes them to the kernel for execution.


what is linux file system heirerchy

The Linux File System Hierarchy is a logical arrangement of files and directories used by the Linux operating system. 
It is rooted at the root directory '/' and organized in a tree-like structure that reflects the organization of files 
and directories. At the top of the hierarchy is the root directory, which contains all other directories and files. 
Directly below the root directory are the bin, sbin, usr, and lib directories, which contain the executable files for
the system. Below those are the boot and dev directories, which contain files used during the boot process.
The home directory is where users store their personal files. The etc, proc, and var directories contain 
configuration files and system data. The tmp directory is used for temporary files.
 Finally, the mnt directory is used for mounting external devices.



what are linux basic commands with simple example

1. ls – list directory contents
2. cd – change directory
3. mkdir – make directories
4. rmdir – remove directories
5. mv – move or rename files or directories
6. cp – copy files or directories
7. grep – search for patterns in files
8. man – display manual pages for commands
9. chmod – change access permissions for files or directories
10. find – search for files by name or other criteria
11.touch - to create empty file
12.echo - to write text to display
13.cat - to disply text on an file


Examples: 
1. ls – ls -l /home/user       (list the contents of the home directory)
2. cd – cd /usr/bin            (change the current directory to /usr/bin)
3. mkdir – mkdir new_folder    (create a new directory called ‘new_folder’)
4. rmdir – rmdir old_folder    (remove the directory called ‘old_folder’)
5. mv – mv old_name new_name   (rename a file from ‘old_name’ to ‘new_name’)
6. cp – cp file1 file2         (copy the contents of ‘file1’ to ‘file2’)
7. grep – grep ‘text’ file.txt (search for the word ‘text’ in the file ‘file.txt’)
8. man – man ls               (display the manual page for the command ‘ls’)
9. chmod – chmod 755 file.txt  (change the access permissions of ‘file.txt’ to 755)
10.touch example.txt - This will create an empty file called "example.txt".
11.echo "Hello World" - This will write the text "Hello World" to the display.
12.cat example.txt - This will display the contents of the file "example.txt" on the screen.
